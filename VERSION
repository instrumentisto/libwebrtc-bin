# WebRTC doesn't have its own versioning, so we use Chromium versions:
# https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases
WEBRTC_VERSION=128.0.6613.84
# Look for the concrete revision for WebRTC in:
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/<WEBRTC_VERSION>/DEPS
WEBRTC_COMMIT=e7686023a186ac233ed1284da45cc166c0df4e1a

# Additional revision of the `WEBRTC_VERSION` added as `-rN` suffix to it, and
# tracking additional changes applied on top of it.
# Required for being able to release new versions without waiting for the
# `WEBRTC_VERSION` bump. If absent or is commented out, then no `REVISION` is
# added to the `WEBRTC_VERSION`.
